# The Veggie Table 
This is a project I made for  [Start2Impact's](https://www.start2impact.it/) React course with the aim of letting the user look up recipes through Spoonacular API.

## Features 
It is a website the allows the user to search vegetarian recipes based on various parameters such as cuisines or ingredients. I also integrated other parameters within the search function itself with the aim to let the user filter through the recipes based on their requirements, such as meal type, the time it takes to prepare or the amount of calories it has per serving. 


## Built with 
- HTML, CSS, Sass
- JavaScript
- React
- Axios
- Redux
